## Description
Every individual you meet, every emotional touchpoint, and even every serendipitous coincidence is meticulously crafted for you by a sophisticated AI. Yet, you remain oblivious to this orchestration â€” for you, this is your authentic life journey. In "Veil of Reality", each decision and choice is met with real-time AI responses, crafting a unique and unpredictable life narrative for you. As you immerse yourself, you're compelled to ponder: What is real? What is preordained? In this unparalleled life simulation game, the lines between reality and fabrication have never been so blurred.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework written in Python.
- **Faker**: A Python package to generate fake data.
- **Hugging Face**: Libraries for advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. 

> **Note**: The backend system requires approximately 20 seconds to start as the Large Language Models (LLM) require this time to initialize.

## Backend Setup
To get the backend up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Install Flask and Related Packages**: Make sure you have Flask and other required packages installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy ...
   ```

2. **Configure Database URI**: In `init.py`, update the database URI to point to your local MySQL instance.

3. **Load Initial Data**: Run `load_csv_to_db.py` to populate your database with initial data:
   ```bash
   python load_csv_to_db.py
   ```

4. **Start the Backend**: Finally, start your Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The backend should now be running and can be accessed via the specified port.
